# Simple Social (React)

This is a tiny single-page social media demo built with React (via CDN) and persisted to localStorage. It's meant for quick prototyping â€” no backend required.

How to run

- Option A: Open in browser
  - Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser.
- Option B: Start a quick static server (recommended)

```bash
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps

- Add user profiles and persistence with a backend
- Support images/videos
- Add pagination and search
